# Waterdeep Dragon Heist - Player Guide


## Session Zero

The goal for Session Zero is to come up with a basic idea of your backstory, and nail down the core aspects of your character (race, class, background). This can always be fleshed out more as you play.

#### Step 1: Who are you?

The first step is to establish a character concept. This is the elevator pitch for your character. It can be one sentence, or even just a few words. An honorable thief. A noble who lost their lands. A scholar with a drinking problem. This idea is what will drive the rest of your decisions in building your character.

#### Step 2: How did you get to this point?

Try to come up with two or three "defining moments" from your character's past. It could be the moment you first met your spouse, the day you left your hometown, or the first time you killed someone. It's okay to be vague here. Just try to think about what might have led to who you are today.

#### Step 3: Why are you in Waterdeep?

This campaign takes places entirely in the city of Waterdeep so it's important to establish what brings you to the city, why you would stay, and importantly, why you would join up with a group of strangers. See the next page for a quick guide to the city if you need a better idea of the city itself.  

**A word of advice!** As you create your character concept, consider that this campaign takes place in a densely-populated urban metropolis, where openly wielding weapons or magic on the streets can quickly land you in a jail cell. Combat isn't always the solution, and not all combat has to be lethal.

### Choosing a background

This part of character creation is probably best done **at** Session Zero together as a group, so you can bounce ideas off each other to make sure you're a well-rounded group in terms of skills and abilities. The following info is meant to provide a mechanical structure around the character concept you have in mind, but don't feel limited by the options presented. We can always customize as needed!

A background will help guide how you pick the following:

- Two personality traits (Slow to anger, quick to laugh)

- One ideal that drives your character (Family, loyalty, or honor)

- One bond that represents your connection to the world (Finding a
  lost artifact)

- One flaw (Claustrophobic, gambling addict, gullible, brash)

See Appendix A for a list of backgrounds.

A Brief Guide to Waterdeep
==========================

Waterdeep is a bustling, crowded, busy mercantile city where coin is king and tolerance for people of all races and religion is high.  Waterdhavians live life at a fast pace, and despite their fervent work ethic, they rarely miss an opportunity to celebrate, with festivals often going on all day and all night. In Waterdeep, wealth brings respect, respect earns influence, and influence is power.

City Life
---------

#### Government

The city is governed by the Masked Lords, an anonymous group of representatives who are in turn led by the Open Lord of Waterdeep.

#### Economy

Economic activity in Waterdeep has been dominated by the city's dozens of guilds for more than three centuries, and virtually all commerce flows through them.

#### Law

The City Watch enforces the day-today law in the city, while the Magisters act as judge and jury. Both are swift to mete out justice as needed and are guided by the Code Legal.

#### Military

The City Guard (and its famed griffon-riders) defends the city from outside threats, along with the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors.

Places & Landmarks
------------------

#### Yawning Portal Inn

Waterdeep's most famous inn, named for the large "well" within its walls that down into the dungeon of Undermountain. A common destination for would-be heroes.

#### Walking Statues

These 100-ft tall statues were built as a defense mechanism of the city, but once wreaked havoc due to a magical disaster years ago. They've since laid dormant.

#### Wards of Waterdeep

The city is divided roughly into 8 wards, each of which serves its own purpose. The Castle Ward is the seat of government, the Trade Ward the center of commerce, and so on.

Important People
----------------

#### Laeral Silverhand

The current Open Lord of Waterdeep. Helped oust Dagult Neverember.

#### Dagult Neverember

The previous Open Lord. Removed from power and exiled for corruption

#### Vajra 'Blackstaff' Safahr

Archwizard of Waterdeep, leads Force Grey (see factions)

#### Durnan

Runs the Yawning Portal Inn. Former adventurer, well beyond the typical human age.

#### Volothamp Geddarm

A legendary traveler and storyteller, most famous for his guidebooks.

Factions
--------

#### Emerald Enclave

Opposes threats to the natural world, but recognizes the need for balance between civilization and nature. Many of its members are druids, rangers, or those who worship nature.

#### Force Grey (or Gray Hands)

Elite adventurers who work for the government of Waterdeep.

#### Harpers

A semi-secret organization dedicated to promoting good, preserving history and maintaining a balance between civilization and nature.  Has spies placed in cities across the realm.

#### Lord's Alliance

A coalition of rulers from cities across Faer√ªn, who collectively agree that some solidarity is needed to keep evil at bay. Includes Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and others.

#### Order of the Gauntlet

Formed to destroy evil in the world at large. Many members are paladins, clerics, or monks.

#### Zhentarim

An affiliation of merchants and mercenaries known for their cutthroat tactics. Rumors have emerged of a schism among their members in Waterdeep.

PHB = Player's Handbook, SCAG = Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide

# Sword Coast Adventures Guide Backgrounds

The backgrounds described in the Player's Handbook a re all found in
Faerfi n's various societies, in some
form or a nother. This chapte r offers
additional backgrounds for characters in
a Forgotten Realms campa ign, many of
them specifi c to Faerfi n or to the Sword
Coast and the North in pa rticular.
As in the Player's Handbook , each of the backgrounds
presented here provides proficiencies, languages, and
equipment, as well as a background feature and sometimes
a variant form. For personality tra its, ideals,
bonds, and flaws, most of the backgrounds in this chapter
use a thematically similar background in the Player's
Handbook as their fou ndation. 

## City Watch

You have served the community where you grew up, standing as its fi rst line of defense against crime. You aren't a soldier, directing your gaze outward at possible enemies. Instead, your service to your hometown was
to help police its populace, protecting the citizenry from
lawbreakers and malefactors of every stripe.

You might have been part of the City Watch of Waterdeep,
the baton-wielding police force of the City of Splendors,
protecting the common folk from thieves and rowdy
nobility alike. Or you might have been one of the valiant
defenders of Silverymoon, a member of the Silverwatch or
even one of the magic-wielding Spellguard.

Perhaps you hail from Neverwinter and have served
as one of its Wintershield watchmen, the newly founded
branch of gua rds who vow to keep safe the City of
Skilled Hands.

Even if you're not city-born or city-bred, this background
can describe your early years as a member of
law enforcement. Most settlements of any size have
their own constables and police forces, and even smaller
communities have sheriffs and bailiffs who stand ready
to protect their community.

__Skill Proficiencies__: Athletics, Insight
Languages: Two of your choice
Equipment: A uniform in the style of your unit and
indicative of your rank, a horn with which to summon
help, a set of manacles, and a pouch containing 10 gp
FEATURE: WATCHER'S EYE
Your experience in enforcing the law, and dealing with
lawbreakers, gives you a feel for local laws and crimina
ls. You can easily find the local outpost of the watch
or a simila r organization, and just as easily pick out
the dens of criminal activity in a community, although
you're more likely to be welcome in the former locations
rather than the latter.
VARIANT: INVESTIGATOR
Ra rer than watch or patrol members are a community's
investigators, who are responsible for solving crimes
after the fact. Though such folk a re seldom found in

The Homebrewery makes the creation and sharing of authentic looking Fifth-Edition homebrews easy. It uses [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) with a little CSS magic to make your brews come to life.

**Try it! **Simply edit the text on the left and watch it *update live* on the right.



### Editing and Sharing
When you create your own homebrew you will be given a *edit url* and a *share url*.  Any changes you make will be automatically saved to the database within a few seconds. Anyone with the edit url will be able to make edits to your homebrew. So be careful about who you share it with.

Anyone with the *share url* will be able to access a read-only version of your homebrew.

# Appendix

### Not quite Markdown
Although the Homebrewery uses Markdown, to get all the styling features from the PHB, we had to get a little creative. Some base HTML elements are not used as expected and I've had to include a few new keywords.

___
* **Horizontal Rules** are generally used to *modify* existing elements into a different style. For example, a horizontal rule before a blockquote will give it the style of a Monster Stat Block instead of a note.
* **New Pages** are controlled by the author. It's impossible for the site to detect when the end of a page is reached, so indicate you'd like to start a new page, use the new page snippet to get the syntax.
* **Code Blocks** are used only to indicate column breaks. Since they don't allow for styling within them, they weren't that useful to use.
* **HTML** can be used to get *just* the right look for your homebrew. I've included some examples in the snippet icons above the editor.



```
```


### Images
Images must be hosted online somewhere, like imgur. You use the address to that image to reference it in your brew. Images can be included 'inline' with the text using Markdown-style images. However for background images more control is needed.

Background images should be included as HTML-style img tags. Using inline CSS you can precisely position your image where you'd like it to be. I have added both a inflow image snippet and a background image snippet to give you exmaples of how to do it.



### Crediting Me
If you'd like to credit The Homebrewery in your brew, I'd be flattered! Just reference that you made it with The Homebrewery.
